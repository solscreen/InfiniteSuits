<b>Purpose:</b> Wanted to learn Backbone and Backbone Relational so I used this project as a way to do so. 

<b>What is it?:</b> It is a peer to peer e-commerce website built using a Ruby on Rails backend. It is kind of like a 99dresses.com for men. A user can list items that they own on the site and other users can buy them using virtual currency called gold. In the process I also got better at JQuery and JQueryUI.
